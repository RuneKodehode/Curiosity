            Goal 1: Determine whether life ever arose on Mars
          </h2>
          <p className="text-left font-light text-lg tracking-wider">
            The first step in understanding the possibility of past or present
            life on Mars is to determine whether the red planet ever had
            environmental conditions able to support life.
            <br />
            <br /> Now that NASA's two Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and
            Opportunity, have found compelling evidence that liquid water once
            persisted on the surface of Mars, scientists hope to determine if
            other things necessary for life were also present. <br />
            <br />
            With a single rover bigger than both the Viking landers sent to Mars
            in the 1970s, Mars Science Laboratory looks for chemical elements
            that are the building blocks of life. These building blocks include
            six elements necessary to all life on Earth: carbon, hydrogen,
            nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. <br />
            <br />
            Life requires small amounts of other elements, such as iron, along
            with sources of energy. On Earth, this energy comes from sunlight or
            from electrons moving back and forth between elements and compounds
            in nature. Life also requires a stable enough environment to get a
            foothold without being eradicated by natural hazards such as
            volcanic explosions or excessive ultraviolet radiation.
            <br />
            <br /> The Mars Science Laboratory is studying carbon and water
            cycles on the planet through its history. That is, it seeks to
            determine in what form and amount carbon and water is stored on the
            planet or in its atmosphere and how that may have changed through
            time.

                Goal 2: Characterize the climate of Mars
              </h2>
              <p className="text-left font-light text-lg tracking-wider">
                Mars Science Laboratory is characterizing Mars' ancient climate
                and climate processes for the lower and upper atmosphere. In the
                past, a warmer Mars might have supported a thicker, wetter
                atmosphere. But now, with its thin, cold atmosphere, much of the
                water on Mars has left the surface and atmosphere.
                <br />
                <br /> Most of it is probably trapped under the surface, either
                as ice or possibly in liquid form if any exists near a heat
                source on the planet, such as a volcanic "hot spring." An
                earlier thicker, wetter atmosphere may have provided better
                environmental conditions for supporting microbial life in Mars'
                early history.
                <br />
                <br /> Mars Science Laboratory allows scientists to determine
                more precisely the composition of the Martian atmosphere, for
                instance, by measuring the stable isotopes of elements such as
                carbon. (Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have
                different masses because they have a different number of
                neutrons in the nucleus.) Most elements of biological interest
                have two or more stable isotopes.
                <br />
                <br /> Organisms often selectively use particular isotopes based
                on their availability and mass. Environmental conditions also
                affect the availability of various isotopes. Mars Science
                Laboratory looks for biosignatures - signs of life - such as
                abrupt changes in isotopic abundance that might be associated
                with life, and investigates the composition of rocks, soils, and
                land forms that might be linked with changes in the planet's
                atmosphere over time.
                <br />
                <br /> Mars Science Laboratory is studying Martian weather
                patterns and characterizing the distribution of water, carbon
                dioxide, and hydrogen in the atmosphere and near the surface. It
                also measures surface radiation, including cosmic rays, solar
                protons, and neutrons bombarding the planet from space. [more on

                A record of Mars' history is folded in the layers of the martian
                surface -- in essence, geology's version of tree rings. Mars
                Science Laboratory studies the rock and soil record in order to
                understand the geologic processes that created and modified the
                martian crust and surface through time. In particular, it looks
                for evidence of rocks that formed in the presence of water.

                By demonstrating an ability to land large, heavy payloads on the

                equipment and the huge infrastructure needed by any human

                <br />
                Experience in precision landing techniques also provides the
                first early steps in developing an ability to send astronauts to
                a given location safely and reliably. A better understanding and
                characterization of radiation levels at the surface of Mars will
                help mission planners understand potential hazards faced by any
                future astronaut crews and design methods for protecting their
                health.
